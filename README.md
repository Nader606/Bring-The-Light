# Bring-The-Light

This project is a real-time visualization of particles following the edges of detected objects in a video feed. It uses computer vision techniques to detect objects and edge detection algorithms to create a dynamic particle system that follows the silhouette of detected objects.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes the COCO-SSD model to detect objects in a webcam feed.
- **Edge Detection**: Applies Sobel operators to detect edges within the bounding box of detected objects.
- **Particle System**: Particles are generated along the detected edges and move in a flow field-like behavior.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Particles continuously follow the moving edges, creating a visually engaging effect.
- **Edge Detection & Following**: 
    - Particles are attracted to and follow the nearest edges, creating a responsive system that adapts to its environment.
    - **Edge Detection**: is achieved by calculating the distance between particles and predefined edge points. Particles that are too far from the edges are removed and respawned closer to the edge.
- **Flocking Behavior**: Particles exhibit flocking behavior using three key principles: 
    - **Separation**: Avoiding crowding and maintaining personal space by steering away from nearby particles. 
    - **Alignment**: Aligning with the velocity (direction and speed) of neighboring particles, creating cohesion within the flock. 
    - **Cohesion**: Steering toward the average position of nearby particles, helping the flock stay together.
- **Flow Field Influence**: 
    - A noise-based **flow field** is applied to guide particle movement, giving the system a more organic, fluid-like behavior. 
    - The flow field updates every 10 frames to improve performance while still providing dynamic movement patterns.
- **Particle Tail & Glow**: 
    - Each particle leaves a trail, representing its path over time. The tail gradually fades as the particle moves, creating a fluid-like motion. 
    - Particles have a glow effect that becomes more pronounced with distance from the particleâ€™s center.

## Technologies Used

- **p5.js**: A JavaScript library for creative coding, used for rendering graphics and handling video input.
- **COCO-SSD Model**: A pre-trained object detection model from TensorFlow.js, used for detecting objects in the video feed.
- **JavaScript**: The core programming language used to implement the logic and functionality of the project.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic web technologies used to structure and style the application interface.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nader606/Bring-The-Light.git
   cd BringTheLight
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Ensure you have a local server setup to run the project, such as using VSCode's Live Server extension or Python's SimpleHTTPServer.

3. **Run the Application**: 
   Open `index.html` in your browser using your local server setup.

## Usage

- **Webcam Access**: The application requires access to your webcam. Ensure you allow webcam permissions when prompted.
- **Full-Screen Mode**: Click on the canvas to toggle full-screen mode for an immersive experience.
- **Window Resizing**: The application automatically adjusts to window resizing.

## Important Notes

- **Performance**: The application may have performance issues on lower-end devices due to real-time video processing and particle rendering.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure you are using a modern browser that supports WebRTC and WebGL for optimal performance.
